# Simple Pentesting Phases

This page is a table listings each method for penetration testings.

## 1. Reconnaissance

This phase is the very beginning of penetration testings or bug bounty programs.  
We look for the information about the company, subdomains, or more additional details for the client or the target.

- [Reconnaissance](/exploit/reconnaissance/)
- [OSINT](/exploit/osint/)
- [Google Dorks](/exploit/google-dorks/)
- [Subdomain Discovery](/exploit/subdomain-discovery/)

<br />

## 2. Scanning

When we gathered information about the target, next we scan open ports.

- [Port Scan](/exploit/port-scan/)

<br />

## 3. Vulnerability Assessment

From here we start testing specific services which are known to some extent in the previous phase.

### DNS

[DNS](/exploit/dns-pentesting/)

### Web

[Web Basic Pentesting](/exploit/web-basic-pentesting/),  [Web Content Discovery](/exploit/web-content-discovery/), [Web Login Bypass](/exploit/web-login-bypass)

- **Attack Vectors**

    [Cookie Hijacking](/exploit/cookie-hijacking), [CORS Attack](/exploit/cors-attack), [File Inclusion](/exploit/file-inclusion), [File Upload Attack](/exploit/file-upload-attack/), [Reverse Shell](/exploit/reverse-shell/)
    [SQL Injection](/exploit/sql-injection/), [SSRF](/exploit/ssrf/), [SSTI](/exploit/server-side-template-injection/), [XSS](/exploit/xss/), [XST](/exploit/xst/)

- **CMS**

    [CMS Pentesting](/exploit/cms-pentesting), [WordPress Pentesting](/exploit/wordpress-pentesting)

- **Web Frameworks**

    [Angular](/exploit/angular-pentesting/), [Django](/exploit/django-pentesting/), [Flask Jinja2](/exploit/flask-jinja2-pentesting/), [Spring](/exploit/spring-pentesting/)

### Windows

[Active Directory](/exploit/active-directory-pentesting/), [Kerberos](/exploit/kerberos-pentesting/), [LAPS](/exploit/laps-pentesting/), [LDAP](/exploit/ldap-pentesting/), [SMB](/exploit/smb-pentesting/), [Windows Print Spooler Service](/exploit/windows-print-spooler-service/)

<br />

## 4. Gaining Access & Exploitation

We attempt to break into the target system in practice using vulnerabilities that we found.

### Linux

- [Linux Privilege Escalation](/exploit/linux-privilege-escalation/)
- [Sudo Privilege Escalation](/exploit/sudo-privilege-escalation/)
- [Polkit Privilege Escalation](/exploit/polkit-privilege-escalation/)

### Windows

- [Windows Privilege Escalation](/exploit/windows-privilege-escalation/)

### Containers

- [Docker Pentesting](/exploit/docker-pentesting/)
- [Kubernetes Pentesting](/exploit/kubernetes-pentesting/)
- [LXC/LXD Privilege Escalation](/exploit/lxc-lxd-privilege-escalation/)

<br />

## 5. Post Exploitation

After gaining access, we try post exploitation. For instance, create backdoors and put them into the system.

### Linux

- [Linux Backdoors](/exploit/linux-backdoors/)

### Windows

- [Mimikatz](/exploit/mimikatz/)

## 6. Reporting

When we finished to penetration testing, we write the report to let the client know the results.
