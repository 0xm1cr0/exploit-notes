    wireshark sample.pcap
    ```

- **Tcpdump**

    ```sh
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 icmp

    # For Wireshark
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 icmp -w /tmp/tcpdump.pcap
    ```

- **Brim**

    [Brim](https://www.brimdata.io/) is an application to search and analyze super-structured data.

## Detect a Type of Malware

1. Extract files from PCAP.

    1. Open target pcap file on Wireshark.
    2. Select "File" -> "Export Options" -> "HTTP..."
    3. Save the target file.

2. Get the MD5 hash.

    ```sh
    md5sum suspicious.exe
    ```

3. Search on VirusTotal using the MD5 hash.
