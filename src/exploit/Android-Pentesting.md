## Android Backup (.ab)

### Extract

```sh
(printf "\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" ; tail -n +5 sample.ab) | tar -xvz
```

<br />

## APK Reverse Engineering

### Extract APK File

You can retrieve "classes.dex".

```sh
unzip example.apk -d ./Example
```

Now you can observe files.  
For **React Native**, it may contain the sensitive information in the bundle file.

```sh
strings assets/index.android.bundle
```

### Convert DEX to JAR

You can retrieve JAR file.

```sh
d2j-dex2jar classes.dex
```

### Observation

**JD-GUI** is a JAVA decompiler tool. It reveals class in the JAR file.  
Open JD-GUI.

```sh
jd-gui
```

<br />

## Reverse Engineering

```sh
# Decode APK file
apktool d example.apk -o ./example

ghidra
```

<br />

## Dynamic Analysis

If you pentest on virtual devices, you need to install some emulator as below. 

- **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)**
- **[Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/)**
- **[Nox](https://www.bignox.com/)**
