## Investigation

Suppose that the following RPNG program in Python. The seed, which is used for the random number generator, is generated from the time when the program runs.

```python
import random
import time

seed = int(time.time())

random.seed(seed)

num = random.randint(1, 100)
print("Generated number: ", num)
```

If we can get the seed, we can generate the same number as this program.

<br />

## Exploitation

There are several ways to guess the number. Here are some of the examples.

### Run Program at the Same Time

If we can retrieve the program source code, we can run the custom exploit inherited from it, then run it at the same time.

### Get the Seed from Target System Time

If we can know when the program executed in target system, we may be able to calculate the seed from the system time of the target.
