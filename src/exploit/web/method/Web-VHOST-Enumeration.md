## Enumeration

```sh
# Ffuf
ffuf -u http://example.com/ -H "Host: FUZZ.example.com" -w wordlist.txt -fs 1234
# follow redirect (-r)
ffuf -r -u http://example.com/ -H "Host: FUZZ.example.com" -w wordlist.txt -fs 1234

# Wfuzz
wfuzz -u http://example.com -H "Host: FUZZ.example.com" -w wordlist.txt --hl 138
```

If we found vhosts, add them to the **`/etc/hosts`** in our machine.

<br />

## Enumeration (HTTPS)

To enumerate **`https`**, specify the **`IP addresss`** not **`domain`** to URL.

```sh
ffuf -u https://10.0.0.1 -H "Host: FUZZ.example.com" -w wordlist.txt -fs 1234
```

<br />

## SAN (Subject Alternative Name) in the Certificate

SAN is an extension to X.509 that allows various values to be associated with a security certificate using a subjectAltName field.  
We can also check it for finding subdomains.  
Replace **"example.com"** with your target domain.

```sh
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 < /dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text | grep -C3 -i dns
```
