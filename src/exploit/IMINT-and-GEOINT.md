## Video (mp4) Geolocation

FFmpeg extracts every single frame from a video.

```bash
# -i: input file
# %06d: followed by six digits e.g. img_000001.png, img_000002.png, etc.
# -hide_banner: hide unnecessary text.
# -r: frame rate (e.g. 1 frame per second)
ffmpeg -i example.mp4 -r 1 img_%06d.png -hide_banner
```
