## Interact with Contract

We can interact with the contract that is already deployed in Ethereum chain if we have the private key of the account and the contract address.

```bash
export ETH_RPC_URL="http://10.0.0.1:12345"

# Call the function of the contract
cast send --private-key <private_key_addr> <contract_addr> "exampleFunc(uint256)" <argument_value_of_the_function>
cast send --private-key 0xa5de3dc36b45a5c676321dab3456b22bd4ab63379fe27d136fa4b597ea63c4a6 0x2b572cFa179008D4a36980D6E02c3C5276c34117 "deposit(uint256)" 10

# Trigger the fallback function
# Call the nonexisting function e.g. "dummy"
cast send --private-key <private_key_addr> <contract_addr> "dummy()"
cast send --private-key 0xa5de3dc36b45a5c676321dab3456b22bd4ab63379fe27d136fa4b597ea63c4a6 0x2b572cFa179008D4a36980D6E02c3C5276c34117 "dummy()"

# Trigger the receive function
# Send Ether to call the receive function
cast send --private-key <private_key_addr> <contract_addr> --value 10gwei
cast send --private-key 0xa5de3dc36b45a5c676321dab3456b22bd4ab63379fe27d136fa4b597ea63c4a6 0x2b572cFa179008D4a36980D6E02c3C5276c34117 --value 10gwei
